<h1>Angular Application using TypeScript</h1>

<p>This application consists of several components:</p>

<h2>Home Component:</h2>
<p>Displays a list of cards using *ngFor loop, including a child component app-tcgplayer.</p>

<h2>Tcgplayer Component:</h2>
<p>Displays specific information related to Tcgplayer. Uses two child components app-prices to show Holofoil and Reverse Holofoil details.</p>

<h2>Prices Component:</h2>
<p>Displays prices for a specific category (Holofoil or Reverse Holofoil). Uses a list style to show different prices (Low, Mid, High, Market, Direct Low if present).</p>

<p>Each component is connected to services or data, and the overall project utilizes Angular to create a reactive web application. The components are structured to make the application modular and reusable, following best practices in Angular development.</p>
